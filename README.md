# MasterMind
MasterMind colors guessing game implemented in Smalltalk for Pharo 6.1 and in C++ for the Ubuntu terminal. Not tested for other distributions.

Rules of the game are as follows:

1. You have to guess the combination of five non repeating colors between red, green, blue, yellow, white, black, magenta and brown.
2. The symbol ⬡  means one color is in the combination at the right place, while ⬢  means a color is in the combination, but at the wrong place.
3. You have 12 attempts. If you've not guessed the right combination by then, you will lose.
